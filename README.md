This Is A Repository Documenting Real Life Incidents I Encounter
# Security Reports

This repository documents real-world security incidents and investigations encountered during professional engagements, personal research, or red team/blue team simulations.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Share actionable insights and lessons learned from real-life incidents.
- Provide transparency into investigation and response processes.
- Help others recognize patterns, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and improve their own security postures.
- Encourage continuous learning in cybersecurity through practical case studies.

## Structure

Each incident report will be stored as a separate Markdown file under a consistent naming convention:
ex: process_incdent



Each report generally includes the following sections:
- **Incident Summary**
- **Detection Method**
- **Analysis Process**
- **Tools Used**
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
- **Lessons Learned**
- **Remediation/Response**
- **Supporting Artifacts** (when applicable)

All sensitive details (usernames, IPs, internal system names, etc.) are anonymized or obfuscated where necessary to preserve confidentiality and comply with responsible disclosure practices. This content is for educational and documentation purposes only.
